					I got my start in programming at age 11 continuing to dabble (though never professionally)
					throughout my life.  After working with a friend of mine to create and manage a software
					infrastructure for a IT hardware recycling facility (Akooba Inc.) for a year and a half,
					I filled in my knowledge with Thinkful's online program and now am ready to solve problems
					as a software developer.
