					<p>In 7th grade I took my first programming class: Visual Basic.  Throughout high school and 
					college I would continue to take programming classes in a variety of topics and languages,
					but would eventually graduate with a Philosophy degree from Miami University (Ohio) compelled
					by the belief that my softer skills were underdeveloped and somewhat assuming that I had plenty
					of time to find my way back to software development.  After working with a friend of mine to
					help create and manage software for a IT hardware recycling facility (<a href="https://akooba.com/">Akooba Inc.</a>) for a year and a half,
					I filled in my knowledge with a course in full-stack development with Thinkful while preparing myself for the job market</p>
					<p>I have always enjoyed problem solving through computer programming.  Solving logic puzzles and mathematics 
					was always fun for me, and programming gave me the chance apply that creatively.  I look forward to working with a team of
					programmers and solve some problems!
					</p>
					<p>In my free time I play video games, chess, tennis, and write code to ongoing projects.  Feel free to contact me at imussg@gmail.com
					and check out <a href="https://github.com/imussg">my github</a> and/or my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-imus-3b3a1a52/">linkedin profile</a></p>
